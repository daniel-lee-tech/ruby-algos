# Semordnilap

A Semordnilap is when a word is reversed and it creates another word. This is in stark contrast to a palindrome where the reversal of 1 word equals the same word.  In this algorithm, create an object that takes in an array of words and returns an array of pairs that will return words that are a pair of semordnilap.

Example 1:

```ruby
input = %w[abc cba 12 31 racercar racecar]
output = [
  %w[abc cba]
]
```
